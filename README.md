PHL Crime Mapper
================

[This application](http://www.phlcrimemapper.com) allows you to access [the Philadelphia Part I crime data](http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/215/philadelphia-police-part-one-crime-incidents) released by the Philadelphia Police Department in December of 2012. Users will have a different experience depending on if they are on a smartphone, tablet or desktop/laptop computer.  

The laptop/desktop version allows the user to draw a polygon of the area that they are interested in for any six-month range over the last three years.  Once the crimes for that area are shown, the user can then show/hide the different types of crimes as they wish.  

On smartphones, users can select a 3, 5 or 10 block radius (approximate) around their current location to view the crimes for that radius over the last month.  

A tablet version is still in the works.

It is also still a work in progress.

Future
======

This is only the beginning!  Besides UI and optimization improvements, version 2.0 will allow users to sign-up for weekly/monthly email or SMS alerts for an area that they are interested in.
